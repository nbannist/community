General Project Description
---------------------------

A web application that gives members the tools to organize the conversation and information surrounding the problems, projects, and policies in their communities. Hopefully, the tools will allow more people to not only more easily keep track of things going on in their communities, but also allow them to engage with others in the community about those items so that the problems are better solved and the projects and policies better serve their purpose.

Idea
----

Most people would agree that there doesn't seem to be enough time in the day to do everything they need to do. So, of course, some of these activities suffer neglect. One class of activities that at times is pushed to the side lines is keeping up with goings on in ones communities. Their communities could be their neighborhoods, cities or towns, counties, states, schools, or even a group or organization. Reading the newspaper (in dead-tree format or online) can only get you so far. And interacting and asking questions about the information found there can be time consuming. Newpapers are only updated daily not minute-by-minute. And who do you contact about project X? ...


Off the Cuff Ideas
------------------

- Conversations use the four objects used in "Dialog Mapping"--Idea, Question, Pro, Con--to build a conversation (dialog) around a specific topic. Add to that though, Reference, to link to documents with pertinent information to back up or further explain the Idea, Question, Pro, or Con being used.
- Somehow, though, we need to be able to distill that dialog into an organized, readable document instead of the tree structure "dialog maps" usually come in. A tree structure may show how everything relates but 
- Project overview/synopsis to initiate people who are just passing by and don't have time to look at the dialog.
- Easy but sophisticated tagging and categorizing system for Topics/Conversations.
- System in the vein of Wikipedia and StackOverflow.com, where the web application's community keeps things in order; everything is editable (but tracked) and because, ultimately, it's for the good of the community everything posted would be licenced (StackOverflow.com uses the Creative Commons license).

Example Topics
--------------

 - Are there any innovative, proven deterrents that can be implemented to prevent graffiti by the 3rd street park?
 - How can we become a more environmentally neutral organization?
